# Moonwalk Architecture Documentation

This directory documents the Moonwalk architecture, primarily by using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).

ADRs are stored in the [decisions](./decisons) directory, and should be created and managed using the [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) scripts which can be installed on any operating system.  For those wishing to create ADRs manually, the [template](./decisions/template.md) is also provided.

Supplemental material that is not part of a decision, such as examples or more detailed explorations of relevant topics, can be added in this directory rather than the decisions directory.
